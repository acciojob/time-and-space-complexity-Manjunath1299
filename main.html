	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>The Time complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task (considering that each operation takes the same amount of time). The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity.</p>
	<p><strong>Space Complexity</strong> of O(n) means that for each input element there may be up to a fixed number of k bytes allocated, i.e. the amount of memory needed to run the algorithm grows no faster than linearly at k*N.</p>
